# Hangman

Hangman is a classic and popular online word guessing game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. The game begins with the user having the option to read the rules or create a username and select a difficulty level, ranging from easy to hard.

Once the game has started, the user is prompted to guess a letter, and if they are correct, a message will indicate the correct letter placement, and the gallows and previously guessed letters will be displayed. However, if the user guesses incorrectly, they will receive an incorrect message and the gallows will be updated with a penalty, moving them one step closer to losing the game.

Overall, Hangman is a fun and challenging game that requires both guessing skills and vocabulary knowledge, making it a great way to test your abilities and have fun at the same time.

## How to Play

In this implementation of Hangman, you will play against the computer. 
You will be prompted to choose a difficulty level (easy, medium, or hard), and the computer will randomly select a word from a list of words corresponding to that level. 
You will then have to guess the letters in the chosen word before the hangman is complete.

## User Experience (UX)

Hangman is a classic word guessing game that provides a simple yet entertaining user experience. The user is presented with a blank series of dashes that represent the letters of a mystery word. They have to guess the letters in the word, one at a time. With each correct guess, the letter is revealed in the corresponding position(s). However, with each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman's body is drawn. The user can guess until they either correctly guess the entire word or the hangman is fully drawn, resulting in a loss. The game is easy to learn and provides a good balance of challenge and reward. It is also a great way to improve vocabulary and spelling skills while having fun.

## Manual Testing

The game was manually tested extensively using codeanywhere terminal, and once the website was deployed on Heroku it was manually tested again, during the creation of the code to the end. Testing of rules display, username input validation, select difficulty input validation, gallows ASCII image display, correct and incorrect answers and finally win or lose display and play again feature.

## Fixed Bugs

* There is a warning notice that informs the user that there is just one chance remaining if he reaches his fifth guess before attempting to use a last guess. This meant that even if the user correctly identified the final letter after receiving a warning after his fifth guess and so winning the game, the warning message would still appear.
* This bug was fixed in the play_game function which was refactored to keep track of the is_game_won function in the code that runs the warning, final chance message, which can be found in the commits history.
* This bug was indentified by playing the game multiple times and trying to get to all possible outcomes that a user might experience while playing the game.
