# The Magical Token Machine

The "Magical Token Machine" presents an intriguing and novel gaming experience for those who dare to challenge fortune. This enthralling game permits participants to wager their tokens and place bets on up to five lines, thus amplifying the prospects of securing substantial rewards.

Prior to the commencement of the gameplay, participants are required to deposit their tokens into the machine. This represents the stake with which they will engage in the game. Participants have the liberty to wager on a maximum of five lines. Opting for multiple lines escalates the likelihood of triumph, albeit concurrently increasing the stake. A victory is ascertained when three homogeneous letters align sequentially on any of the wagered lines. For instance, a triumph is declared if the combinations A|A|A, B|B|B, C|C|C, or D|D|D materialize on any of the active lines. The magnitude of the reward is contingent on the number of lines wagered. The more lines wagered, the greater the reward. The reward is calculated by multiplying the number of lines wagered by the number of tokens wagered. For instance, if a participant wagers 5 tokens on 5 lines and secures a victory, they will be rewarded with more tokens.The manifestation of the 'E' symbol bestows participants with bonus tokens or even a rare additional spin. This element introduces a transformative potential to the dynamics of the game and injects an additional layer of excitement.

## How to Play

Before engaging with the "Magical Token Machine," a player must accept the game's rules. Once agreed, they deposit their tokens and decide how many lines to wager on, each line offering a separate chance to win. After the stakes are set, the machine reveals the outcome, updating the player's token balance based on their victory or loss. Finally, the player can choose to either cash out their earnings or continue playing, diving back into the thrilling cycle of risk and reward.

## Manual Testing

The game was manually tested extensively using VScode terminal, and once the website was deployed on Heroku it was manually tested again, during the creation of the code to the end. Testing of rules display, user input validation, using differnt inputs to break code, correct and incorrect answers and finally win or lose display and play again feature.

## Fixed Bugs

* Initially, the application was hindered by syntax errors that disrupted its smooth operation. Through meticulous code analysis and rigorous testing, these errors were identified and rectified. This intervention has significantly improved the reliability and performance of the application, ensuring that commands are interpreted and executed as intended. 
* A particularly challenging bug was identified in the initial deployment, where the multiplication of tokens did not function correctly. This issue was critical, as it directly affected the core functionality of the application. Through a thorough examination of the underlying algorithms and logic, the bug was successfully isolated and fixed, restoring the integrity of the token multiplication feature and ensuring accurate transaction processing.
